# Electoral Bond Analysis 

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the sales of electoral bonds by the State Bank of India (SBI) in relation to the 2019 Member of Parliament (MP) elections in India. The analysis explores the distribution of electoral bond sales among political parties and investigates any correlation between bond sales and election outcomes.

## Data Preprocessing
Before conducting the analysis, the dataset underwent several preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data. These steps included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types as necessary. Additionally, the dataset was merged with relevant election results data to enhance the analysis.

## Analysis
### Total Electoral Bond Sales
The analysis begins by examining the total amount of electoral bonds sold by SBI. Visualizations such as bar charts and pie charts are used to illustrate the distribution of sales among different political parties.

### Electoral Bond Sales per MP
Next, the analysis calculates the electoral bond sales per MP and explores the distribution of sales among individual MPs. Histograms or box plots may be used to visualize this distribution.

### Relationship Between Electoral Bond Sales and Election Results
Finally, the analysis investigates the relationship between electoral bond sales and MP election results. Correlation analysis is performed, and scatter plots or line graphs are used to visualize any correlations observed.

## Results
